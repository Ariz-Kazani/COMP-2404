# COMP 2404 FALL 2024 Course Notes

## Background

This is all of my course work completed in the fall of 2024 with Prof. Darryl Hill. 
This repository has been made public with the permission of prof Prof. Darryl. All code 
was written in an linux vm by me and *should* be compatible with most unix based 
systems. All data is in the main branch, if you notice any other branches, they were
purely used for submission purposes. There are two folders, Tutorials and Assignments
Tutorials were small exercises that would prepare us for the assignments. Assignments 
were larger projects.

## Tutorials

### Tutorial 1
#### Introduction to basic concepts, such as variables, input and output and output parameters.

### Tutorial 2
#### Introduction to classes and namespaces

    "In this tutorial you will simulate a battle between two Characters, an orc from Mordor and a fighter from Gondor. If they fight in Gondor, the fighter will have the advantage, and if they fight in Mordor, the orc will have the advantage. These two places will be defined by their namespaces.

    You will make a class Character to represent the orc and the fighter. This will include both Character.h and Character.cc files. In addition you will have files battle.h and battle.cc. These two files should define two global fight functions in different namespaces. Note: battle is not a class. The battle.h file contains the function prototypes and the battle.cc contains the function implementations. Finally you will have a main.cc file with a main function to run the battle."


### Tutorial 3
#### Learn to use GIT, submit a file to gradescope using git

### Tutorial 4
#### Memory management 

    "In this tutorial you will complete two more classes from Assignment 2: the FileList class (Section 5.4.1) and the Repo class (Section 5.5). In addition, if you have not yet completed it, you will also complete the Date and File classes from Section 5.2 and 5.3. There is a test file provided, test.cc, that calls on TestControl and Tester to test the functions that you provide from those classes. You are provided with a Makefile - make any changes you see fit (and remember that Linux is case sensitive!). As usual the test script, t4test.py is provided. This script is run with valgrind, so it will check the valgrind output to see if there are memory leaks or invalid reads or invalid frees."

### Tutorial 5
#### Memory management with data structures 

    "In this tutorial you will provided the modified versions of the Date and File (Section 6.2) classes. These are classes originally from Assignment 2 Sections 5.1 and 5.2, but you will modify them for Assignment 3 according to the instructions in Section 6.1 and 6.2. 
    
    You will also write two other classes, HeapArrays and StackArrays. There is a test file provided, test.cc that will test the functions that you provide from those classes. There is a second test file, test2.cc, that will test whether you properly constâ€™d your classes. A Makefile that compiles all classes into object files and compiles test.cc and test2.cc into executables is provided. As usual the test script, t5test.py is provided. This time the script is run with valgrind, so it will check the valgrind output to see if there are memory leaks."

### Tutorial 6
#### Memory management with objects (destructors and deep-copy's)

    "In this tutorial you will complete two more classes from Assignment 3: the FileList class (Section 6.4) and the Repo class (Section 6.3). In addition, if you have not yet completed it, you will also complete the Date and File classes from Section 6.2. There is a test file provided, test.cc, that calls on TestControl and Tester to test the functions that you provide from those classes. You are provided with a Makefile - make any changes you see fit (and remember that Linux is case sensitive!). As usual the test script, t6test.py is provided. This script is run with valgrind, so it will check the valgrind output to see if there are memory leaks or invalid reads or invalid frees."

### Tutorial 7
#### Inheritance, templates, and function pointers

    "Write the Drawable, User, Driver and Customer classes from Assignment 3, Sections 6.2 - 6.7. This tutorial tests that you have constructed the id correctly, and tests the List class to ensure your compare function is working correctly. This does NOT test the Drawable or View classes, but since Customer and Driver inherit from Drawable, and Drawable uses a View, they should be included."

### Tutorial 8
#### Multiple inheritance and polymorphism

    "Write the Episode and all of the Search classes from Assignment 4, Sections 5.1 and 5.4. This tutorial tests the matches functions from your Search classes, as well as checks that you have overloaded the stream insertion operator (<<) correctly (using polymorphism)."

### Tutorial 9
#### "Template" a class implement operator overloading

    "If you have not already, write the Episode class from Assignment 5, Section 5.4. In particular, ensure that you have implemented the Episode::operator<<. Then complete the Array class from Section 5.2."

### Tutorial 10
#### Learn to use the STL library

    "In this tutorial you are to implement an Algorithms class. This class will read in a collection Student objects and perform different operations on them such as sorting."
