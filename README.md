# COMP 2404 FALL 2024 Course Notes

## Background

This is all of my course work completed in the fall of 2024 with Prof. Darryl Hill. 
This repository has been made public with the permission of prof Prof. Darryl. All code 
was written in an linux vm by me and *should* be compatible with most unix based 
systems. All data is in the main branch, if you notice any other branches, they were
purley used for submission purposes. There are two folders, Tutorials and Assignments
Tutorials were small exersizes that would prepare us for the assignments. Assignments 
were larger projects.
